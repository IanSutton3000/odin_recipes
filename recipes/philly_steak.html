    <h2>This is a simple and easy recipe for a great philly steak sandwich</h2>
    <p>
        These Philly cheesesteak sandwiches are made with a delicious seasoning of herbs and spices. 
        I purchase steak that has been sliced for making stir-fry, which takes a little less time, 
        but achieves the same results.
